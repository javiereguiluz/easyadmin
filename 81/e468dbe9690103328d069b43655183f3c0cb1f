>     * I created an `Enum` (the first one in this bundle!; this is fine because we now require PHP 8.1 and enums re supported there) to define the possible values of `variant`. I opted for the namespace `Config\Enum\...` because we already have `Config\Option\...` for the constant-based classes. The idea is to turn (in the future) the constants into enums, so we need a different namespace. Do you like `Enum\` or do you prefer a different name?

Why not keep `BannerVariant` in the same namespace at the twig component ?

I don't want to use the exact same namespace because "component" != "component option".

But your comment gave me an idea: use the Config/Option namespace inside Twig/Component namespace

Yes,  "component" != "component option", but will this option ever be used outside of configuring the component, or another component ?

Folks, thanks for the comments and reviews. I made most of the changes you proposed and also changed other things thanks to the comments shared on Symfony Slack. Thanks ðŸ™Œ
