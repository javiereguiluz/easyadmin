I like this change a lot ... but after merging this, some people might get angry at me because this is a BC break. But, since we just introduced the pretty URLs feature, it might be OK, more or less üôè

Seems my PR description disappeared. Yes I was wondering the same, I'm not sure if this feature is marked as experimental. A previous PR removed ending slashes on index paths and no one complain so I'm assuming this is OK.

Also @javiereguiluz is there is reason to not use `symfony/string` methods here ?

I would also prefer this! Shouldn't be too hard to make this configurable also
