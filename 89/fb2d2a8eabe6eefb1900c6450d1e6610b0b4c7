@Sobak thanks for this contribution. I don't mind the trait extending solution ... but I was wondering, shouldn't we instead add the new code line below these two lines?

Hi @javiereguiluz, thanks for the quick review.

I didn't feel confident enough with the project to suggest such solution, I don't know for sure if it's going to cause some backwards incompatible changes, but if you say it's a sensible behavior for all field types, then I'll update this PR momentarily.

Done, I force-pushed the commit. I also tested your suggested change with my project manually and it works like expected for `AssociationField`.
