This PR adds 2300+ SVG files, will it slow down the installation of this bundle? I'm thinking about all these files which will be decompressed and created on every CI job that use EasyAdmin.

I don't have an alternative solution to offer.

@alexislefebvre yes, I thought about that.

Initially, this PR also added Tabler icons, which added +6,000 additional icons. I removed that because it was too much. But, in the case of FontAwesome, I think it's a reasonable tradeoff. This adds a ~2,000 small files, but also removes +2,000 CSS classes injected in all admin pages. We can also validate icon names, trigger deprecations when legacy icon names are used, etc. So, I think it's worth it ðŸ™Œ
