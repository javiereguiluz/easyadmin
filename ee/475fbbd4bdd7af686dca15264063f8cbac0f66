BTW
Did you notice that a margin-bottom property has now been added below the alerts:?

@pfpro that's bad ðŸ˜  Could you please check where that error comes from and, if possible, send a pull request to fix it? If you can't create the PR, just debugging where this happens is fine. Thanks!

I think we could change this line:

https://github.com/EasyCorp/EasyAdminBundle/blob/03f593ab43599f129ad77fbb3293dd23c1793a3a/templates/flash_messages.html.twig#L10

and add "mb-0":

`<div class="alert alert-{{ label }} alert-dismissible fade show mb-0" role="alert">`

@pfpro thanks! I've fixed that issue in this PR too.
